# Sign-Sense AI Net: Understanding Hand Gestures in ASL

The Sign-Sense AI Net project focuses on developing a machine learning model capable of recognizing hand gestures in American Sign Language (ASL). The goal of the project is to enhance communication between the hearing impaired and the general public by providing a robust and accurate system for interpreting sign language gestures.

## Project Tech Stack:

- Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras 
- Deep Learning Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Data Preprocessing:
- Image resizing and normalization
- Data augmentation (e.g., rotation, translation, scaling) to increase model robustness
  
## Model Architecture:
- Input layer: RGB image data representing hand gestures
- Convolutional layers: Extract features from input images
- Pooling layers: Reduce spatial dimensions and retain important features
- Fully connected layers: Make predictions based on extracted features
  
## Training:
- Split dataset into training, validation, and testing sets
- Train the CNN model using labeled hand gesture images
- Utilize appropriate loss functions (e.g., categorical cross-entropy)
- Optimize model using an optimizer (e.g., Adam)
  
## Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy: Measure the percentage of correctly classified gestures
- Loss: Monitor the convergence of the model during training
  
## Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set
- Analyze accuracy, loss, and potentially confusion matrices
- Fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary

By employing a Convolutional Neural Network and leveraging a kaggle dataset of hand gestures, this project aims to contribute to the advancement of sign language recognition technology, ultimately improving communication accessibility for the hearing impaired community.
